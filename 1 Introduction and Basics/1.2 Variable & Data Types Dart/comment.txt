Comments

Comments are the set of statements that are ignored by the dart compiler during program execution.
They are used to explain the code so that you or other people can understand it easily.

Types of Comments

   1. Single-Line Comment: For commenting on a single line of code. E.g. // This is a single-line comment.
   2. Multi-Line Comment: For commenting on multiple lines of code. E.g. /* This is a multi-line comment. */
   3. Documentation Comment: For generating documentation or reference for a project/software package. E.g. /// This is a documentation comment
