Operators In Dart:
    Operators are used to perform mathematical and logical operations on the variables.

Types of Operators:
    They are different types of operators in dart
        1.Arthmetic Operators
        2.Increment and Decrement Operators
        3.Assignment Operators
        4.Relational Operators
        5.logical Operators
        6.Type Test Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are the most common types of operators. They perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
Operator Symbol |    Operator Name  	Description
            + 	|         Addition  	For adding two operands
            - 	|      Subtraction 	    For subtracting two operands
        -expr 	|      Unary Minus 	    For reversing the sign of the expression
            * 	|   Multiplication 	    For multiplying two operands
            / 	|         Division 	    For dividing two operands and give output in double
           ~/ 	| Integer Division 	    For dividing two operands and give output in integer
            % 	|          Modulus 	    Remainder After Integer Division


2.Increment and Decrement Operators

with increment and decrement operators, you can increase and decrease values.

Operator Symbol 	  Operator Name 	Description
++var 	              Pre Increment 	Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var+1
--var 	              Pre Decrement 	Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var-1
var++ 	              Post Increment 	Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var
var-- 	              Post Decrement 	Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var

3.Assignment Operators

It is used to assign some values to variables. Here, we are assigning 24 to the age variable.

Operator Type 	Description
= 	            Assign a value to a variable
+= 	            Adds a value to a variable
-= 	            Reduces a value to a variable
*= 	            Multiply value to a variable
/= 	            Divided value by a variable

4.Relational Operators

Relational operators are also called comparison operators. They are used to make a comparison.

Operator Symbol 	Operator Name 	            Description
> 	                Greater than 	            Used to check which operand is bigger and gives result as boolean
< 	                Less than 	                Used to check which operand is smaller and gives result as boolean
>= 	                Greater than or equal to 	Used to check which operand is bigger or equal and gives result as boolean
<= 	                Less than or equal to 	    Used to check which operand is smaller or equal and gives result as boolean
== 	                Equal to 	                Used to check operands are equal to each other and gives result as boolean
!= 	                Not equal to 	            Used to check operand are not equal to each other and gives result as boolean
