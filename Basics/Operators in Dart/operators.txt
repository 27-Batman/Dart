Operators In Dart:
    Operators are used to perform mathematical and logical operations on the variables.

Types of Operators:
    They are different types of operators in dart
        1.Arthmetic Operators
        2.Increment and Decrement Operators
        3.Assignment Operators
        4.logical Operators
        5.Type Test Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are the most common types of operators. They perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
Operator Symbol |    Operator Name  	Description
            + 	|         Addition  	For adding two operands
            - 	|      Subtraction 	    For subtracting two operands
        -expr 	|      Unary Minus 	    For reversing the sign of the expression
            * 	|   Multiplication 	    For multiplying two operands
            / 	|         Division 	    For dividing two operands and give output in double
           ~/ 	| Integer Division 	    For dividing two operands and give output in integer
            % 	|          Modulus 	    Remainder After Integer Division


2.Increment and Decrement Operators

with increment and decrement operators, you can increase and decrease values.

Operator Symbol 	  Operator Name 	Description
++var 	              Pre Increment 	Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var+1
--var 	              Pre Decrement 	Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var-1
var++ 	              Post Increment 	Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var
var-- 	              Post Decrement 	Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var

3.Assignment Operators

It is used to assign some values to variables. Here, we are assigning 24 to the age variable.

Operator Type 	Description
= 	            Assign a value to a variable
+= 	            Adds a value to a variable
-= 	            Reduces a value to a variable
*= 	            Multiply value to a variable
/= 	            Divided value by a variable
